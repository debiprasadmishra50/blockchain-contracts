Blockchain and Bitcoin
================================================================

First Blockchain of the world designed by Stuart Haber and Storneta and a company called surety which publishes a hash every week in the New York Times. 

Bitcoin - Technical Features
---------------------------------------
    - Cryptographic Hash Functions
    - Time-stamped append-only logs(Blocks)
    - Block headers and Merkle Trees
    - Asymmetric Cryptography and Digital Signatures
    - Addresses
    - Consensus through proof-of-work
    - Network of Nodes
    - Native Currency
    - Transaction input and output
    - Unspent Transaction Output (UTxO)
    - Scripting Language


Cryptography
--------------------------------
    - Communications in the presence of Adversaries
    - Computation in the presence of Adversaries

Hash Function
--------------------------------
    - Digital Fingerprints for data
    - General Properties
        - Maps input X of any size to an output of fixed size - called a HASH
        - Deterministic: Always gives the same hash for input X
        - Efficiently computed

    - Cryptographic Properties
        - Preimage resistant (one-way) : infeasible to determine x from from the Hash(x)
        - Collision resistant: infeasible to find and find x and y where Hash(x) = Hash(y)
        - Avalanche Effect: You change x slightly and Hash(x) changes significantly
        - Puzzle Friendliness: knowing Hash(x) and a part of x, it is still very hard to find the rest of x
          
    - Digital Signatures for data
        - Used for
            - names
            - references
            - pointers
            - commitments

        - Bitcoin Hash Functions
            - Headers and Merkle Trees - SHA256
            - Bitcoin Address: SHA256 and RIPEMD160


Block Header
-----------------------
    - Version
    - Previous Block Hash
    - Merkle Root Hash
    - TimeStamp
    - Difficulty target
    - Nonce


Digital Signature Algorithms
-------------------------------------------
    - Generate key-value pairs: Public key(Pk) and Private key(Sk) from random numbers
    - Signature Function: Creates Digital Signatures(Sig) from message(m) and Private Key(Sk)
    - Verification: Verifies if a Signature(sig) is valid for a message(m) and a Public Key(Pk)


- Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm(ECDSA)


- How the coins get created with each block mined if block contains transaction informations.
- How and why there is a limitation on the generation of coins like in the bitcoin.

Network
---------------------
    - Full Nodes: Stores full blockchain and able to validate all transactions
    - Pruning Nodes: Prune transactionsafter after validation and aging
    - Lightweight Nodes: Simplified Payment Verification(SPV) nodes, stores blockchain headers only.
    - Miners: Performs proof of work and create new blocks, Do not need to be a full node
    - Mining pool operators
    - Wallets: Store, View, Send and receive Transaction and create key pairs
    - Mempool: Pool of unconfirmed transactions


Alternative Consensus Protocol
-----------------------------------------
    - Generally Randomized or Delegated Selection of Nodes to validate next Block
    - May have added mechanism to confirm block validators' work
    - Randomized selection may be based upon:
        - Proof of stake: Stake in native currency
        - Proof of activity: Hybrid of POW and POS
        - Proof of Burn: Validation comes with burning coins
        - Proof of Capacity: Based on hardware space

    - Delegated selection may be based upon Tiered System of Nodes
    - Major Permissionless Blockchain Applications still use Proof of Work through.


Transaction Format:
-----------------------------------------

    Input                             Output

    Previous transaction ID         public key(addresses)
    Index

    Signature
    ----------------------------------------------------------
                    lock_time


    
Coinbase Transaction
-----------------------------------------
    - Reward for solving the Puzzle of proof-of-work
