# Blockchain Building from Scratch

## Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)

- A distributed ledger technology is like a database that is spead across several sites
- DLT is any system that distributes data across multiple computers/servers/nodes.
- Several DLTs are
  - Blockchain
  - Tempo
  - DAG etc...
- All blockchains are DLTs but all DLTs are not Blockchain

### Benifits

- Faster Transactions
- Remove Middleman
- Reduce Costs
- More Secure
- Transparent

### Components of DLTs

- Transforming Internal Processes and Operations
  - Payments
  - Asset Tracking
  - Data Sharing
  - Identity Management
- Transforming Business Models
  - Customer Engagements
  - Micro Transaction
  - Creating New Markets
- New Opportunities
  - Funding
  - Access to Data
  - Crowd Funding
  - Self Governed Organisations

### What makes DLTs

1. Cryptography
2. Transactions
3. Smart Contracts

#### Cryptography

- Asymettric Cryptography algorithm like ECC is used to generation of keys
- Hashing algorithm SHA256 is used to generate digital signatures
- RIPEMD160 is utilized for hashing addresses
- Networking protocols like TLS or Gossip Protocol are utilised for creating the peer to peer network

#### Transactions

- Transactions are records of data in chronoligical order
- Transactions are stored in Merkle Tree inside the Block
- The transactions, when submitted, are picked up by the blockchain network and is inserted into a "pool of unconfirmed transactions". The transaction pool is a collection of all the transactions on that network that have not been confirmed yet
- Miners on the network select transactions from this pool and add them to their "block".
- Transactions also contain metadata information which can be utilized to store data over the blockchain.

#### smart Contracts

- Smart contracts are the digital contracts signed between two parties and stored over the immutable ledger
- Smart contracts help you exchange money, property, shares or anything of value in a transparent conflic-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman
- Contracts can be encoded on any blockchain, but Ethereum is the mostly used since it gives an unlimited processing capability
- Hyperledger is also providing chain codes which are very similar to smart contracts
- Example: renting an apartment

## Blockchain

- The blockchain is a TIme-stamped cryptographically-secured distributed and decentralised immutable digital public ledger that is publicly shared across all the nodes of it's network.

- Ledger
  - It servers a purpose of storing transaction data
